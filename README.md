# Gmailbot-v1.0

The script is an email automation tool utilising the yagmail library, https://pypi.org/project/yagmail/. 

The primary difference you will see in the script that is in this repo, is the csv.reader that parses over the table you place in the sam directory. 

The purpose of the script is if you are looking to do some promotional or initial outreach to potential buyers of a product or service that may help start the relationship with them, displaying what you have to offer as a business or individual. 

* This is not intended to be used for spam or mass mail-out for scams. 

To get this script to work you need create a corresponding .csv file as attacked in the repository. The script will parse over the columns and input the variables in the required areas. 

Add any comments or updates please. 

Happy codemas.
